            With the rapid growth of technology these days, new idea spring up from different niches. <br> However, the Small Business Administration Concludes 21.5% of startups fail in the first year. <br> 30% in the second year, 50% in the fifth year,
            and 70% in their 10th year.

            <p class="mt-2">
                This led Adbirt team to carry out extensive research, on why most startup fails. <br> We realized marketing takes the highest chunk of their budget, since the giant <br> marketing company like <span class="second-session">Facebook and Google</span>                charge per click (CPC) also known <br> as cost-per-click regardless of the end-users take action on the promoted <br> campaign such as purchase or signup, download and install etc.

            </p>

            <p>
                That gave birth to Adbirt CPA marketing, a robust technology that helps every business owner <br> and start-ups companies promote their business to their potential customers online and only <br> pay for results. No sales or new lead to
                your business, you don't have to pay a <span class="third-session">dime.</span>
